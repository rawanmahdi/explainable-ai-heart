# Explainable AI for mHealth ML Developers #
Over the past decade, ML has made clear it's profound use in a variety of fields in medicine, including mobile healthcare, that is apps that provide some kind of healthcare oriented service to it's user. 

Integrating predictive models into widley accessible platforms like health apps serves a high risk to public health and saftey if the model behaviour is not thorughouly analyzed and validated from both the technical and clinical standpoint. Although increasingly complex models - such as neural networks - provide greater preformance, their black box nature makes their decisions diffcult to interpret as opposed to simpler models such as decision trees.
